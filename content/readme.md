My name is Chance Jiajie Li. I am currently an [graduate student](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/jiajie/overview/) at the City Science (formerly Changing Places) group at the MIT Media Lab. As a developer and researcher, my overarching goal is to enhance urban systems from a media technological perspective.
